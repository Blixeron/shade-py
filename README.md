# Dust, my personal Discord bot, written in Python, using Discord.py

## Instalation

Clone this repository, and install the discord.py library by using `python3 -m pip install discord.py` or (if you are in Windows): `py -3 -m pip install discord.py`. Then you can start the bot by running the `main.py` file.

## .env File

There's a hidden file that stores sensitive information, called `.env`. If you want to run the bot, you must create it inside of the bot's folder.

This is how it looks like:

```
TOKEN= Your bot's token.
GUILD_ID= The development server ID.
APP_ID= The ID of the bot.
DEV_ID= The ID of the bot owner.
```
